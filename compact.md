## Team Charter

## Team Rules
Respect each other's ideas and opinions 
Respect each other's personal time
Be mindful of deadlines 
Maintain contact regarding tasks and scheduling 
Notify team members if struggling and/or falling behind on a task.

## Team Roles
Project Manager: John

Everyone else switches around
## Work flow
Basecamp: Posting documents, keeping a schedule and checklist.

Discord: Main group communication

Github: Project base, complete and partial, all work shows up here.

Weekly meetings outside of class, through Discord Voice Chat.

## Communication
Communications occur through Discord or email, Discord done first. Meetings are mandatory, and occur through Discord. Keeping team rules in mind, notify when you will not be able to attend, and notify on team statuses and when we need help. Clear communication is key.

## Consequences
Consequences: No communication within 3 days via Discord or E-mail will be notified to Professor Hajek and the individual's evaluation will be affected. The first time, the group is notified, see how this can be avoided, if it happens again, get the professor involved. Work consequences depend on communication efforts,

## Restoring work
Every Sprint, the project manager should keep local backups of the github 24 hours beforehand, just in case. Restores should go to the previous iteration.
