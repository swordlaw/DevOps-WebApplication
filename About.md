## About Our Project: Hello World
### Our app, called "Hello World", will be a three-tiered, multi-user Advice Column centered around general life-related questions. At the initial page of the app, any user, can view questions and answers. In order to ask a question, one has to create an account and log in with their authentication, which they can do at the log-in page. Additionally, at the log-in page, one can sign up to be an "expert", where only they have the ability to answer questions that are asked. Hence, we have three users with three different views. All of our data, including log-in information, questions, and answers, will be stored in a SQL database.
